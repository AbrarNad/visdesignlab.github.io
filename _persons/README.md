# VDL Profiles

## Creating a member profile for VDL

Please create a profile here. Use the following template. Don't remove rows if you don't have the information right now, just leave the data empty. E.g., if you don't know what your interests are yet, leave the field blank but don't delete "interests".

### Picture

Pictures are only necessary for active members of VDL, not for collaborators.

And add a black and white headshot to this folder: 
https://github.com/visdesignlab/visdesignlab.github.io/tree/master/assets/images/team
And a colored one here: 
https://github.com/visdesignlab/visdesignlab.github.io/tree/master/assets/images/team_colored
Format: square JPG, up to 400x400 px, make sure **this is under 20kb**!


## Creating a collaborator profile 

Use "role: collaborator" for collaborators on papers. Note that this isn't strictly necessary, you can just type the person's full name in the author list, but it might be useful if you're collaborating with a person a lot.
