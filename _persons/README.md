# VDL Profiles

## Creating a member profile for VDL

Please create a profile here. Use the following template. Don't remove rows if you don't have the information right now, just leave the data empty. E.g., if you don't know what your interests are yet, leave the field blank but don't delete "interests".

## Creating a collaborator profile 

Use "role: collaborator" for collaborators on papers. Note that this isn't strictly necessary, you can just type the person's full name in the author list, but it might be useful if you're collaborating with a person a lot.
