I am a Software Developer at the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute at the University of Utah. I am working with various
research students on developing visualizations for different data. 
I was a student at Utah State University and I graduated in 2018 with a degree in Computer Science and an emphasis in Software Engineering.
