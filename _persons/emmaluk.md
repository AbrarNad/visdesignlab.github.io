I'm a senior at the University of Utah majoring in Software Development through the School of Computing and minoring in Entrepreneurship through the Eccles School of Business. I am working with Alexander Lex and [reVISit](https://revisit.dev/), a platform for designing online user studies. My current research project will be to recreate a study and then transition into creating my own study, topic still undecided. I am extremely passionate about UI/UX and human centered computing. I aim to wield my creativity to effectively create useful applications that deliver assistance and convenience for its users.
