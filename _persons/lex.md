I develop interactive data analysis methods for experts and scientists. My primary research interests are **interactive data visualization and analysis** especially applied to molecular biology and pharmacology. I concern myself with data analysis challenges that require human reasoning and human intervention. I like to think of my work as **human data interaction**, as interactive visualization, combined with algorithmic and statistical methods, make data accessible for human consumption.


I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the [Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute](http://www.sci.utah.edu/) and the [School of Computing](http://cs.utah.edu) at the University of Utah. Together with Miriah Meyer, I run the Visualization Design Lab where we develop visualization methods and systems to help solve today's scientific problems.


Before that I was a lecturer and post-doctoral visualization researcher in [Hanspeter Pfister's group](http://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/) at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I received my PhD, Master's and undergraduate degrees from the [Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision](http://icg.tugraz.at/) at the Graz University of Technology where I was advised by Prof. Dieter Schmalstieg. In 2011 I was a visiting researcher at Prof. Peter Park's [Computational Genomics Research Group](http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School.

I am on the organizing committee for IEEE VIS, BioVis and the Visualization in Data Science Symposium. I am or was also on the program committee for VAST, InfoVis, PacificVis and EuroVis Short Papers. I review for a wide range of publications including IEEE TVCG, CG&amp;A, ACM CHI, and BMC Bioinformatics.

I am a co-founder and leader of the [Caleydo Project](http://www.caleydo.org/), which is both, software that can be used by life science experts to visualize biomolecular data and pathways, but also a platform for implementing prototypes of radical visualization ideas.
