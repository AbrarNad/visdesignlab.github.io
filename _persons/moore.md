My research focuses on people's relationship with their own data, specifically at the intersection of environmental sensing, exploratory visualization, and personal privacy.  I am currently working with [Miriah Meyer](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~miriah/) and [Jason Weise](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~wiese/) on the NIH's [PRISMS](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/research-funding/prisms) project to help "develop health monitoring systems for measuring environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in pediatric epidemiological studies of asthma".  I just make a user interface for our participants :P

I'm a bit of an atypical CS student, and even moreso a visualization researcher.  My academic background is in math and physics with some professional R&D experience as an electro-optic engineer. I came to Utah for a scientific computing PhD, but switched course to visualization in order to pursue a more collaborative and problem-driven line of research.  

When I'm not computing I like to cook, build speakers, and play synthesizers.
