I'm a software developer here at the Visual Design Lab where I work on full stack deployments of open source projects. Most of the code I deploy is created by faculty and students in the MS and PhD programs.

I got my Bachelor of Science Degree in Mathematics from Westminster College here in Salt Lake City, UT. During my degree, I focused on data science, machine learning, dev ops, and more.

Until recently, I worked in the marketing analytics industry for a start up called [Emperitas](https://www.emperitas.com/). While there, I build graph database applications, machine learning models, and customer lifetime value solutions for clients all over the U.S.
