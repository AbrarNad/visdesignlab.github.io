We are always looking for talented and motivated individuals to join our group as PhD students or Postdoctoral Fellows to do research in data visualization. 

The School of Computing is a top ranked computer science department, and the SCI Institute and the Visualization Design Lab are among the world leaders in visualization - **the University of Utah is ranked #1 worldwide in Visualization according to [csrankings.org](http://csrankings.org).** 

Our group commonly takes a problem-oriented approach to visualization development. We closely work with collaborators from the sciences to humanities to develop novel techniques and tools to support exploratory, complex data analysis tasks.

Current topics of interest include: 

 * Visualization techniques, including multivariate graphs, multivariate data, heterogeneous data, etc.
 * BioMedical data visualization, such as integrated visualization and algorithmic approaches for genomic data, biological networks, patient data, etc.
 * Design studies.
 * Web-based systems for scalable visualization.
 * Methods and models for applied visualization research.
 * Perceptual and cognitive principles for visualization.
 * Visualization for communication and behavior change.
 * Provenance tracking, reproducibility and storytelling. 


## PhD Students

We are looking to admit multiple PhD students to work on a variety of projects related to the aforementioned topics. PhD students are enrolled in the University of Utah's School of Computing, in either a computing or a computer science degree program. Students can choose between a graphics/visualization, human-centered computing, or data science track, among others. Admitted students typically are **guaranteed a year of funding by the school, with subsequent years funded by the lab faculty**. 

We encourage applications from students with degrees in computer science and related fields, but also from other areas, such as bioinformatics, math, physics, design, psychology, etc. Excellent written and verbal communication skills are crucial. If you are unsure whether you are qualified, please [get in touch](mailto:vdl-faculty@sci.utah.edu).  

Admissions are handled by the [School of Computing](http://www.cs.utah.edu/graduate/admissions/); **the admission deadline is December 15**. If you have any questions, please [contact us before applying](mailto:vdl-faculty@sci.utah.edu).  

## Postdoctoral Fellows

Postdoctoral fellowships are available for specific positions (see below), but we are also looking to hire exceptional candidates with a proven track-record of visualization research, regardless of these specific positions. 

Postdoctoral fellows will be responsible for developing a research program in line with the above-mentioned topics of interest. Other responsibilities include day-to-day project management, including coordination with collaborators and other team members, mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, as well as the writing of manuscripts. Contribution to the grant writing efforts of the lab are encouraged.

Candidates must have a PhD degree in computer science or related fields, and have a track-record of publication in the top visualization journals or conferences. Excellent programming skills, working knowledge of state-of-the-art software development techniques, experience collaborating with domain experts, and broad training in evaluation methods are a plus. The candidates interested in these positions must be highly motivated, willing to learn and demonstrate initiative in assigned tasks. Excellent written and verbal communication skills are crucial.

Candidates should submit their CV, a research statement, PDFs of their three best papers, and contact information for three references to [vdl-faculty@sci.utah.edu](mailto:vdl-faculty@sci.utah.edu).

## Open Position for a Postdoctoral Fellow: Biomolecular Data Visualization - PRN14120B

[ARUP laboratories](https://www.aruplab.com/) and the Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute at the University of Utah are offering a post-doctoral position in biomolecular data visualization. ARUP Laboratories is a national clinical and anatomic pathology reference laboratory and a worldwide leader in innovative laboratory research and development. The SCI Institute is an internationally renowned research institute specializing in scientific computing, image processing and analysis, and data visualization. ARUP and the SCI Institute are teaming up to collaboratively create innovative methods and tools for the understanding of complex genetic information. An early focus of this work and the position offered is the creation of a visualization tool to display Copy Number Variation data (CNVs) detected by next generation sequencing (NGS) methods for clinical NGS laboratory testing. This work will result in novel and scalable software that enables efficient interpretation of copy number variants from high throughput NGS data by a domain expert.   
                    
We seek a highly talented and committed individual with a demonstrated ability to work independently and take on leadership in a multi-disciplinary research environment. The successful candidate will contribute to the world-class research and software development and have the opportunity to develop their research, publication, grant writing and presentation skills under mentorship from established faculty investigators. 
                   
#### Non-Technical Skills:
                   
Excellent oral and written communication skills are mandatory.  A willingness to collaborate in a highly diverse, multi-disciplinary environment is also essential.
                   
#### Salary Range: 
$45,000 - $65,000, based on previous experience
                   
#### Position Requirements:
 * Ph.D. in computer science, bioinformatics, or a closely related field
 * A track record of publications in visualization and in bioinformatics journals/venues; ideally in both.
 * A passion for software engineering and for bridging the gap between science and industry.
 * Experience with modern full-stack web development (JavaScript, Web Frameworks, Python, Databases).
 * Experience with large software development projects is a plus.
  
#### Benefits:
The University of Utah offers a very competitive benefits package.
                   
#### How to Claim Vet Preference:

Applicants claiming Veterans or Disabled Veterans preference must submit a photocopy of their DD-214 and complete the Utah State Veteran's Preference Addendum.

#### How to apply: 
Please apply to the University of [Utah Human Resources Department](https://utah.peopleadmin.com/postings/63954). Please include the names of at least three references along with a curriculum vitae and list of publications.

#### Start date: 
Immediate. The initial appointment will be for a one-year period, with the possibility of an extension based upon performance and availability of funding.


#### Equal Employment Opportunity:

The University of Utah, an AA/EO employer, encourages applications from women and minorities, and provides reasonable accommodation to the known disabilities of applicants and employees.
                   
#### The SCI Institute: 

The SCI Institute is a world-class research institute located within the new Warnock Engineering Building on the University of Utah campus.  We are a highly dynamic, driven group of over 200 faculty, staff, and students. The overarching goals of the SCI Institute's scientific computing research are to create new techniques, tools, and systems, by which scientists may solve problems affecting various aspects of human life. We believe that to advance the state-of-the-art and create meaningful computational solutions for such complex systems, one needs to advance research in a number of areas within scientific computing, including: visualization, simulation, and modeling. Furthermore, for this algorithmic and software research to have a real impact outside of scientific computing and computer science, these components must be integrated with data and application specific knowledge within intuitive software systems, problem solving environments (PSEs) or “computational workbenches”.  The SCI Institute presents a highly challenging, collaborative work environment that can be deeply rewarding for the right individual.  Further information is available at www.sci.utah.edu.
